Afternoon Workflow
-------------

**Description:**

The afternoon session will continue to introduce CyVerse cyberinfrastructure platforms, including Atmosphere and BisQue; as well as the Data Commons - a platform for hosting published scientific data.

We will demonstrate some example use-cases involving CyVerse and other NSF funded resources.

The day will conclude with a discussion of how to collaborate with CyVerse through our Extended Collaborative Support service, Powered By features, and examples of Federation.
