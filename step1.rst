**Description Outcomes**

* The history of the iPlantCollaborative, which led to CyVerse will serve as an overview of the last 10 years of the project, to help frame the future directions that we are currently pursuing. 

* The goal of the Data Store overview include understanding how to move new data onto CyVerse Data Store, hosting data publically, and working with iRODS iCommands interface.

* The Discovery Environment section includes the creation of non-interactive apps using Docker, for running individual jobs, as well as pipeline workflow executions. The VICE application platform will also be covered. 

* Agave involves high level examples of working with High Throughput Computing and High Performance Computing in a 'bring your own compute' scenario.
